description: |- Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system or domain accounts.
  Linux On Linux, local users can be enumerated through the use of the /etc/passwd
  file which is world readable. In mac, this same file is only used in single-user
  mode in addition to the /etc/master.passwd file. Also, groups can be enumerated
  through the groups and id commands.
