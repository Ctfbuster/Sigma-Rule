title: Bash History Movements Detection
description: Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with
  the "history" utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the userâ€™s
  .bash_history file. macOS and Linux both keep track of the commands users type in
  their terminal so that users can easily remember what they''ve done. These logs
  can be accessed in a few different ways. While logged in, this command history is
  tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE. When a user logs
  off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user''s home directory
  called ~/.bash_history.
