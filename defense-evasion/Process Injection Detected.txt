title: Process Injection Detected
description: Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address
  space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process
  may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly
  elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from
  security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
