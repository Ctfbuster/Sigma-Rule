title: HISTControl Detected
description: The HISTCONTROL environment variable keeps track of what should be saved
  by the history command and eventually into the ~/.bash_history file when a user
  logs out. This setting can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space
  by simply setting it to "ignorespace". HISTCONTROL can also be set to ignore duplicate
  commands by setting it to "ignoredups". In some Linux systems, this is set by default
  to "ignoreboth" which covers both of the previous examples. This means that " ls"
  will not be saved, but "ls" would be saved by history. HISTCONTROL does not exist
  by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected. Adversaries
  can use this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all
  of their terminal commands.
