title: Trojan Wscript Shell Detected Using Discord Servers (C2C)
description: The attacker makes the discord server C2C and makes the victim download the file via excel. Then it writes the file under "ProgramData" with vmi. If you don't use discord in your network. I suggest you block cdn.discord.com and discord.com.
