title: Possible Ransomware Shadow Copy Deletion Detected
description: Shadow copies are snapshots of part of the filesystem, used for backups
  and restore points. Ransomware may delete these to prevent the user from restoring
  files that it has encrypted or destroyed. Aside from ransomware, shadow copy deletion
  may also be used by other types of malware to remove forensic evidence of malicious
  activity.
