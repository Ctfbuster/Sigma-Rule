title: Turla Droper Detection
description: This method detects malicious services mentioned in Turla PNG dropper
  report by NCC Group in November 2018.The dropper family, referred to internally
  as PNG_dropper, was observed being used as a second stage tool in different targeted
  attacks. One of final payloads that is created by this dropper is an Uroburos variant
  used by the Turla group, which traditionally operates out of Russia. This technique
  is being used to allow the attackers to conceal their secondary payloads, bypassing
  different AV products. Attackers, regardless of their skills and motives, often
  attempt to wrap malicious code in a way that will seem innocuous to practitioners
  and security products.
