title: MSHTA Remote Script Detected
description: HTA or HTML application is a windows technology that allows a full and
  trusted application to be coded as an HTML script. Unlike usual HTML files, which
  run inside a browser and are restricted by a browser sandbox, HTA files are treated
  as trusted standalone applications. They are executed using the Windows HTA host
  binary, mshta.exe, which provides the environment within which the script runs.
  This technology is abused by malware to evade security tools which typically consider
  scripts harmless or have less rigorous requirements from them. Moreover, they bypass
  white-listing based security tools since mshta.exe is a trusted and signed executable.
  This IOC detects an attempt to run a remote script hosted by a webserver as an hta
  file. This is highly suspicious.
