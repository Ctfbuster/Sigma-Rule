title: Endpoint .bash profile and .bashrc Detection
description: bash profile and bashrc are executed in a users context when a new shell
  opens or when a user logs in so that their environment is set correctly. bash profile
  is executed for login shells and bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.
  This means that when a user logs in (via username and password) to the console (either
  locally or remotely via something like SSH), bash_profile is executed before the
  initial command prompt is returned to the user. After that, every time a new shell
  is opened, bashrc is executed. This allows users more fine grained control over
  when they want certain commands executed.
