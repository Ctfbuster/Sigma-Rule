title: Endpoint  File Permissions Modification Detection
description: File permissions are commonly managed by discretionary access control
  lists (DACLs) specified by the file owner. File DACL implementation may vary by
  platform, but generally explicitly designate which users/groups can perform which
  actions. Adversaries may modify file permissions/attributes to evade intended DACLs.  Modifications
  may include changing specific access rights, which may require taking ownership
  of a file and/or elevated permissions such as Administrator/root depending on the
  file's existing permissions to enable malicious activity such as modifying, replacing,
  or deleting specific files. Specific file modifications may be a required step for
  many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via Accessibility Features, Logon
  Scripts, or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files.
