title: Endpoint Hidden File and Directory Deletion Detection
description: To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a
  system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files
  don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal
  commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files
  either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line
  switches (dir /a for Windows and ls –a for Linux and macOS). Adversaries can use
  this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system for persistence
  and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation
  of hidden file
