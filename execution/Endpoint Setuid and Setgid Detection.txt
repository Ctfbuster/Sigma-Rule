title: Endpoint Setuid and Setgid Detection
description: There are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated
  context to function properly, but the user running them doesn’t need the elevated
  privileges. Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done
  by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own
  applications. These bits are indicated with an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing
  a file''s attributes via ls -l. The chmod program can set these bits with via bitmasking,
  chmod 4777 [file] or via shorthand naming, chmod u+s [file]. An adversary can take
  advantage of this to either do a shell escape or exploit a vulnerability in an application
  with the setsuid or setgid bits to get code running in a different user’s context.
  Additionally, adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure
  they''re able to execute in elevated contexts in the future
