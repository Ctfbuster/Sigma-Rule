title: Endpoint Local Job Scheduling Detection
description: On Linux and macOS systems, multiple methods are supported for creating
  pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs cron,  on Windows systems, job scheduling
  on Linux-based systems cannot be done remotely unless used in conjunction within
  an established remote session, like secure shell (SSH). cron System-wide cron jobs
  are installed by modifying /etc/crontab file, /etc/cron.d/ directory or other locations
  supported by the Cron daemon, while per-user cron jobs are installed using crontab
  with specifically formatted crontab files.  This works on macOS and Linux systems.
  Those methods allow for commands or scripts to be executed at specific, periodic
  intervals in the background without user interaction. An adversary may use job scheduling
  to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for Persistence, to
  conduct Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain root privileges, or to run
  a process under the context of a specific account.
