title: MSI Exec Remote Install Detected
description: The Windows Installer (msiexec.exe) is used to install, update, or remove packages in the MSI format. In this case, the /i command line argument to msiexec.exe has been used to install a remote package. In addition, the /q command line argument has been used to perform a silent install. A remote package being installed silently in this way is suspicious.
