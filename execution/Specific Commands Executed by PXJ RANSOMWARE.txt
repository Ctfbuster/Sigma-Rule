title: Specific Commands Executed by PXJ RANSOMWARE
Reference: https://www.threathunting.se/2020/03/17/x-force-iris-warns-pxj-ransomware-strain/
description: Similar to other ransomware, "PXJ", also known as "XVFXGW", starts attacking
  by disabling usersâ€™ access to any file from deleted stores; first, the Recycle Bin
  is emptied with the "SHEmptyRecycleBinW" command. Then a series of commands are
  executed to prevent the recovery of data after encryption. This step contains the
  deletion of volume shadow copies and the disabling of the Windows Error Recovery
  Service. After that, "PXJ" uses both AES and RSA to lock down data as fast as possible
  and in the last step, the ransomware drops a file named "LOOK.txt" that contains
  the ransomware note in which the operators demand victims to contact them via email
  and pay the ransom with Bitcoin in the exchange for the decryption key.
