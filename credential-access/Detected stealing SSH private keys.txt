title: Detected stealing SSH private keys
description: Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication,
  encryption/decryption, and digital signatures. (Citation: Wikipedia Public Key Crypto)
  Adversaries may gather private keys from compromised systems for use in authenticating
  to [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) like SSH or for
  use in decrypting other collected files such as email. Common key and certificate
  file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b,
  .asc. Adversaries may also look in common key directories, such as ~/.ssh for SSH
  keys on * nix-based systems or C:\Users\(username)\.ssh\ on Windows. Private keys
  should require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also
  use for keylogging or attempt to  the passphrase off-line. Adversary tools have
  been discovered that search compromised systems for file extensions relating to
  cryptographic keys and certificates
