title: Credentials in Files Detected
description: Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for
  files containing passwords. These can be files created by users to store their own
  credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration
  files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files
  containing embedded passwords. It is possible to extract passwords from backups
  or saved virtual machines through Credential Dumping.
