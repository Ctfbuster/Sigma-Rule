description: The phishing emails come from a spoofed sender address "meetings[@]webex[.]com" with various striking subject lines such as "Critical Update" or "Alert!". The email explains that a critical vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated user to install a "Docker container with high privileges on the system," and users must immediately update their Cisco Webex application. The email even contains a legitimate URL to a real security advisory published by Cisco back in 2016. The advisory contains details about a vulnerability tracked as "CVE-2016-9223" which is also the URL anchor text. The email then urges users to update their Desktop app and leads them to a "Join" button. The URL embedded into the text "Join", looks quite similar to a legitimate Cisco Webex URL.
